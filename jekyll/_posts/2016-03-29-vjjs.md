I'm working on a multipurpose in-browser livecoding system for remixing the Web.

*Imagine:*

You make a Facebook-style popup, and throw a Google map in it. You make an oscillator, and pipe its output into the longitude and latitude of the Google map. Then you pipe the oscillator into the x and y position of the popup. Etc.

I've been working on various iterations of this for a while, but I haven't been satisfied with any. The current iteration uses the [Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux) (kinda like Flux) architecture, and the modules are React components. I like where it's headed.

[vjjs](https://github.com/vjjs) is a currently-in-development collaboration platform for client-side creative code. It will make it possible to use the browser for livecoding or vjing, and use GitHub as a backend so you can easily share your code or find modules to use.

[baton](#baton) and [fftjs](#fftjs) are components that make vjjs possible.
