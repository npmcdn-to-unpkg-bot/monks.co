I made these <a href="http://amonks.github.io/ctadailyridership">CTA Data Visualizations</a> in 2014 from <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Daily-Boarding-Totals/6iiy-9s97">data</a> put out by the city of Chicago. They graph the <abbr class="initialism" title="Chicago Transit Authority">CTA</abbr>&#8127;s ridership over time.

##### Conclusions:
1. The circle is way less readable than the timeline of all the data
2. The trains have been getting more popular lately
3. People take the train a *lot* on the forth of July, unless it&#8127;s raining.
