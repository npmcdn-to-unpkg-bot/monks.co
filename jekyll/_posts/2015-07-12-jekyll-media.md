## usage

### include

Here's how you can include a media list within a theme:

    { % if post.media %}
      { % include jekyll-media/media.html media=post.media %}
    { % endif %}

If you want to include a single media object, you can use medium.html:

    { % include jekyll-media/medium.html media=post.image %}
