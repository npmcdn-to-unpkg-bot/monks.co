I'm making a multiplayer 90s-style text game (`you're in a dark room, Andrew is here`, `go east`, `say hi to Andrew`, `look around`) to deployed to a guerrilla mesh wifi network on the subway. The game will automatically pop up on people's phones and hopefully some % will play.

I'd like to create a social (if potentially a bit intrusive) experience from the antisocial reality of the commute. It's a lot easier to type `say hello` than to actually say "hello" to a stranger on a train.  Basically a chatroom, but I think styling it as a text adventure gives the whole project a kind of friendly-nostalgic vibe, and gives people a reason to stick around and explore until somebody else connects.
