A couple months ago, Jon Gold wrote a [fascinating article](http://www.jon.gold/2016/05/robot-design-school/) about his work at The-Grid creating "a system that can understand, select & apply typography with the nuance of an expert human designer."

Unfortunately, Jon left The-Grid and never had the opportunity to take the work to production, so I copied him!

[Here](https://amonks.github.io/font-robot) is a big ugly table with analysis of half of the Google Fonts in it. You can click on a font and the app will surface other similar fonts.

You can follow the instructions in the README to analyze the rest of the Google fonts (it only takes a minute, but the output is _way_ too big for localStorage and _slightly_ too big for the Github file-size limit).
