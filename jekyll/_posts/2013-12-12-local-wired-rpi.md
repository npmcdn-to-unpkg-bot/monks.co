At SAIC today, I needed to connect my RPI to my laptop with as much throughput as possible. Normally I would turn on internet sharing my laptop's wifi over ethernet, and then plug the pi into that.

At SAIC however, since the network is extra secure (or something) you can't internet share it.

Instead, configure sharing to share the hethernet network back out over ethernet.
