`GRAVITON` is a game about gravity.

Imagine being gravity. It’s a tough job. You have to literally be the shape of spacetime itself, keep the astral bodies in their rightful orbits, and make it possible for life-as-we-know-it to even exist. But all you have to work with are a bunch of tiny massless gravitons.

On a small scale, you have forces acting between zillions of particles, but those forces come together on a large scale to create the smooth curvature of spacetime and gravitational waves. It’s so crazy, science doesn’t even know how it works.
