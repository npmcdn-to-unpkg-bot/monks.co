[Install](http://radblock.xyz) radblock and watch all of the annoying ads in your life get replaced by awesome net art [by cutting-edge saic students]

firefox only!

[Taylor Cleveland](http://taylorcleve.land/) and I built Radblock as a proof-of-concept online patronage community. Art students can submit images (incl. gifs), and art fans can install a browser plugin and see the art.

Taylor made the html/css and forked [add-art](https://github.com/slambert/Add-Art) to make the plugin. I made the javascript and the backend. I architected it to scale very cheaply, running entirely on lambda and s3. Dynamo would have been a good fit, but I wanted to use only s3 as a challenge.
