<h1 class="pv2 f6 ttu tracked db lh-solid">Résumé</h1>

I'm a developer and designer based in Chicago, IL. I love single-page realtime web-apps, and I also love regular html websites like this one. I'm into scaling cloud infrastructure.

I've been doing full stack web development for more than ten years now.

I enjoy programming using functional paradigms. Especially in Clojure and Javascript. I used to write a lot of Ruby.

## Skills

- Design systems
- Scalable, serverless architectures
- Responsive web design
- Native applications

### GIFBOOTH

GIFBOOTH provides animated gif photobooths at events for brands like Red Bull, Neimann Marcus, and New York Fashion Week.

I built the server-side database and transcoding system, which scales to handle huge spikes in traffic. I also built the single-page web application.

### SAIC BFA

I have a BFA in Art and Technology from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. I took classes ranging from *Algorithms & Artificial Intelligence* and *Human Computer Interaction* to *Programming for Drawing*, *Data Visualisation*, and *Networked Objects*.
