<h1 class="pv2 f6 ttu tracked db lh-solid">Résumé</h1>

I have a BFA in Art and Technology from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

I've been doing full stack web development for more than ten years now.

I enjoy programming using functional paradigms. Especially in Clojure and Javascript. I used to write a lot of Ruby.

I know a great deal about Amazon's AWS cloud infrastructure.
