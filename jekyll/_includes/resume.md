<h1 class="pv2 f4 ttu tracked db lh-solid">Résumé</h1>

I'm a developer and designer based in Chicago, IL. I love single-page realtime web-apps, and I also love regular html websites like this one. I'm into scaling cloud infrastructure.

I've been making websites and applications for more than ten years now. I enjoy programming using functional paradigms. Especially in Clojure and JavaScript. I used to write a lot of Ruby.
