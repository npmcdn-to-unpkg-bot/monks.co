You need someone who can move between technologies and wear different hats in a fast-paced campaign-driven environment.

I pride myself on my ability to dive into unfamiliar tools and teams and hit the ground running. Less than 24 hours after my first time downloading Node, I shipped production code that is still in use today.

I went to art school because it's fast-paced and product-driven. When I have a concept in place, I need to do whatever it takes to ship on time (a half-finished painting is ok, but half-working code is **not art**). That means using the best tool for the job, whether I'm familiar with it or not.

I'm out of town until the 4th, but I'd be delighted to hear from you at <a href="mailto:a@monks.co">a@monks.co</a>, or by phone at (978) 254-1779
