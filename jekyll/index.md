I love the web.

It's supposed to be this huge democratizing force, a place where anyone with an Internet connection can carve out a space for their ideas.

Many people find web development frightening. The technology exists, but education hasn't caught up yet. I love working with non-web-experts to build the agency, confidence, and literacy they need to make the web work for them.

If you need the web to work for you, but you don't yet have the skills to make it happen, or if you just want to talk about javascript, give me a call at 978-254-1779.

Here's [a huge list of everything](/everything/).
