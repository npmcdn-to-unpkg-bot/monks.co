# rpi hardware

In addition to the raspberrypi itself, you'll want the following, in order of decreasing necessity:

* â‰¥ 4gb SD card

* usb power source (ideally a powered usb hub)

* keyboard

* dvi cable to your monitor

* mouse

* wifi dongle

* usb audio ports

## power

If you plug in your powered usb hub, believe it or not you can plug the pi into the hub for power while also plugging the hub into the pi for connectivity.
