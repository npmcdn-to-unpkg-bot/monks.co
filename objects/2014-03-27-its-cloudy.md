<a href="http://amonks.github.io/weather">It's Cloudy?</a> is a weather visualization I made to experiment with the idea of 'truthiness' in data. If you put something in a graph, it looks sciencey, even truthy. People tend to believe graphs: computers don't lie!

This is a frequently-exploited aspect of human nature, if you want to convince people something's true, make a chart. But what about the converse? If you take real data and display it in a non-sciencey way, does it still seem true?

It's Cloudy? seeks to explore that question. It's a visualization of the real-time cloud cover data at the user's location, but presented through a casual 8-bit gaming aesthetic.

The cloudiness of a user's current location determines the cloudiness of the webpage. On a cloudless day, the page will be solid blue. In 50% cloud cover, half of the squares will be filled with clouds.
