The <a href="https://gist.github.com/amonks/8553781">xxxboxxx</a> is a midi controller, a wireless MIDI bridge, an audio-to-midi converter, and a crappy DSP effects rack, built in <abbr title="PureData, the open source Max/MSP">Pd</abbr> on a RaspberryPi.

It outputs <abbr title="Open Sound Contorol">OSC</abbr>-formatted control/note messages over either ethernet or wifi. You can also plug in up to eight additional USB midi devices and they'll start sending data over wifi too. You can also plug in an audio source (I'm a Theremin fan, personally) and it'll convert the audio to midi notes and send them out too.
