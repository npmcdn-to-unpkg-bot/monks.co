Having not released any music in a while, Judd and I decided to knock down their creative wall by challenging ourselves to fully create a mixtape in under an hour. This is that mixtape. Everything from writing to beatmaking to the album cover was done within a 1-hour span.

Mixtape by Creation. 4 freestyles: 3 over tracks by Cupp Cave, and one over a Christopher Knollmeyer edit of Steppin' Out by Joe Jackson. Engineered by clown.
