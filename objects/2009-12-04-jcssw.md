Jesus Christ Super Star Wars, Concord Academy's first (and only, to date) completely student-created opera. JCSSW, written and directed by Andrew J. Murray. It took the plot of George Lucas's Star Wars series, and set it to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar.

Murray and I worked together on the piece. He managed the actors on stage, while I handled the technical aspects, assembling and leading a team of student designers to execute costumes, sound, lights, set design, and most memorably, the wall of TV sets behind the staged action.
