[Wafelijzer](http://wafelijzer.belgianman.com) is web software you can use to make a beautiful and easy-to-run website for your record label or collective. It was built to power [Belgian Man](http://www.belgianman.com)

You can get it up and running in 5 minutes or less, and add artists, albums, news, videos, or even sell merch using the simple online interface.

Wafelijzer looks fantastic out-of-the-box, but it's also totally customizable. Theme it up to your heart's content.

Wafelijzer's development is guided by 3 principles:

1.    **Keep it easy:** You don't need any technical, web development, or coding experience to use Wafelijzer. A label shouldn't need a 'Web Dude,' artists can add easily add their own content.

2.    **Make it free:** Wafelijzer is designed to run on a free [Heroku](http://heroku.com) server.

3.    **Stay lazy:** You already use services like bandcamp, soundcloud, vimeo, and youtube. Wafelijzer automatically pulls your content from these services so you don't have to type the same shit over and over.
