  <p>I made these visualizations in 2014 from data released for the <a href="https://divvybikes.com/datachallenge">Divvy Data Challenge</a>. By exploring and annotating the data, I was able to uncover information about the theft and damage of bicycles in the Divvy bikeshare system.</p>

<div class="four columns">
  <p>I started out by throwing the data into <abbr title="A Popular Open-Source Database">Postgres</abbr>. Then, I fired up Ruby and started exploratorially looping through my tables, adding annotations as I went. I made the final graphs using a combination of heatmap.js and d3.</p>
