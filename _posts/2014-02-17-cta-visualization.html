  I made these <a href="http://amonks.github.io/ctadailyridership">CTA Data Visualizations</a> in 2014 from <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Daily-Boarding-Totals/6iiy-9s97">data</a> put out by the city of Chicago. They graph the <abbr class="initialism" title="Chicago Transit Authority">CTA</abbr>&#8127;s ridership over time.
  <h5>Conclusions:</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>The circle is way less readable than the timeline of all the data</li>
    <li>The trains have been getting more popular lately</li>
    <li>People take the train a
      <em>lot</em>on the forth of July, unless it&#8127;s raining.</li>
  </ol>
