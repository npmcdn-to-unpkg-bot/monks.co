miNType is Kevin Zweerink`s [ntype](//github.com/kevinzweerink/ntype) (try it out at [ntype.blue](//ntype.blue)), but with most of the features removed.

It makes it real easy to put some cool 4d type on your page. You can see an example at the top of this very page.

## major limitations

*   rn you can only have one instance of ntype
*   you can't customize any of the things yet
    *   like the background color
    *   or the rotation
*   it doesn't update when u resize ur window (but does when u refresh)

## how to

see [index.html](https://github.com/amonks/ntype/blob/gh-pages/index.html) for an example.

here's the important bit:

    var ntypediv = document.getElementById("sayhello")
    var ntype = new NType(ntypediv);
    ntype.begin("hi");

## dev

run `npm install` to install the uglifier

then run `grunt` to concatenate the files in `js/` into one file `lib/mintype.js` and then minify it to `lib/mintype.min.js`
