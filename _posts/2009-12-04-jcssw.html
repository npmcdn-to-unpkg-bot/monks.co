  <p>Jesus Christ Super Star Wars, Concord Academy&#8217;s first (and only, to date) completely student-created opera. JCSSW, written and directed by Andrew J. Murray. It took the plot of George Lucas&#8217;s Star Wars series, and set it to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#8217;s Jesus Christ Superstar.</p>

<div class="four columns omega">
  <p>Murray and I worked together on the piece. He managed the actors on stage, while I handled the technical aspects, assembling and leading a team of student designers to execute costumes, sound, lights, set design, and most memorably, the wall of TV sets behind the staged action.</p>
