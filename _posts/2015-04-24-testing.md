# What The Hell Is Testing?

If you've spent any time in programming circles in the last few[<sup>1</sup>](#notes) years, you've probably heard people talk about writing tests.

If you're self-taught, there's a decent chance you have no idea what they're talking about.

## Why test?

Let's say you're writing a pluralizer. You have a main function, `pluralize()`, which takes a string and returns a plural version of that string.

Here's a way-too-basic version, in JavaScript `cause I heard it's the [most popular language](http://javascript.crockford.com/popular.html).

```javascript
// pluralizer.js

function pluralize(string) {
    var lastCharacter = string.slice(-1);
    switch(lastCharacter) {
        case "s":
            return string + "es";
        default:
            return string + "s";
    }
}
```

You'll probably test it out in the console a bit to see if it works (this is called [**manual testing**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_testing)):

```javascript
pluralize("class");
# "classes"
pluralize("chair");
# "chairs"
pluralize("campus");
# "campuses"
```

Everything checks out! [<sup>2</sup>](#notes)

Now, let's say some scientist on GitHub uses your script, but needs to pluralize the word `fungus` to `fungi`. They send you the following pull request:

```javascript
// pluralizer_broken.js

function pluralize(string) {
    var lastCharacter = string.slice(-1);

    // handle words like "fungus" and "nucleus"
    var lastTwoCharacters = string.slice(-2);
    if (lastTwoCharacters === "us") {
        return string.replace("us", "i");
    } else {
        switch(lastCharacter) {
            case "s":
                return string + "es";
            default:
                return string + "s";
        }
    }
}
```

Now I'm sure you wouldn't *write* that code, but you might casually accept it in a pull request.

And now your pluralizer turns `campus` into `campi`. Shit.

So you fix your code:

```javascript
// pluralizer_fixed.js

function pluralize(string) {
    var noChange = ["platypus", "fish"];
    if (noChange.indexOf(string) > -1) {
        return string;
    }

    var usToI = ["nucleus", "fungus", "virus"];
    if (usToI.indexOf(string) > -1) {
        return string.replace("us", "i");
    }

    var lastCharacter = string.slice(-1);
    switch(lastCharacter) {
        case "s":
            return string + "es";
        default:
            return string + "s";
    }
}
```

Pluralization has so many edge cases that it can be really hard to make sure you don't break stuff. But you run through all the words you've thought of, and it seems to work.

```javascript
pluralize("fungus");
# "fungi"
pluralize("nucleus");
# "nuclei"
pluralize("octopus");
# "octopuses"
pluralize("chair");
# "chairs"
pluralize("campus");
# "campuses"
```

Cool!

Maybe it would be handy to build some of these test words into your code to make sure it doesn't break again. That seems like a good way to keep track of your edge cases, too. That's called [**test automation**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation), and it's what people mean when they say *writing tests*.

## Let's test.

Maybe you'll write something like this:

```javascript
// test_pluralizer.js

function itShould(statement, should) {
    if (statement !== true) {
        console.error( "it should " + should + " AND IT DOES NOT! :(" );
    }
}

itShould(pluralize("chair") === "chairs", "pluralize chair");
itShould(pluralize("fungus") === "fungi", "pluralize fungus");
itShould(pluralize("campus") === "campuses", "pluralize campus");
itShould(pluralize("platypus") === "platypus", "pluralize platypus");
itShould(pluralize("nucleus") === "nuclei", "pluralize nucleus");
itShould(pluralize("octopus") === "octopuses", "pluralize octopus");
```

Your `itShould` function takes two arguments. The first one should evaluate to `true`. The second one describes what you're testing.

As long as your statement evaluates to true, you're good. If it doesn't, you get a nice descriptive error. As long as you run `test_pluralizer.js` after making any changes, you can be sure you didn't break anything.

## But wait...

You might eventually figure this out, but the `itShould` method above already exists in [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api#consoleassertexpression-object) and [Node(/io)](https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_assert_value_message), except it's called `console.assert()`. The second argument is optional, the error text is a bit more terse, and it throws you into a `debugger`, but otherwise it does the same thing.

This style of testing is called [assertion testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)).

## Some other terms

Some people would write a list of assertions before starting work on the pluralizer itself. That's called [**test-driven development**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). It can be a good way to force yourself to think through the edge cases your program will have to deal with.

When designing a program, it's helpful to separate the functionality of that program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.[<sup>3</sup>](#notes) This approach scales very well: functions, classes, and packages are all examples of modules. One reason for designing modular programs is that it makes it easy to recombine the modules to make new programs.

Individually testing the modules that make up your program is called [**unit testing**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing).

Testing the way modules work when combined together is called [**integration testing**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing).

## Fakes

Often, your modules will depend on interaction with other modules. That makes them hard to unit test. For example, let's say you're writing a really fancy alarm clock. If it's sunny, you want to wake up at 7 and bike. If it's rainy, you'd rather sleep in till 7:30 and take the train. You have three modules: `Weather` checks the weather, `Noise` makes a loud noise, and `Clock` calls the first two.

```javascript
// clock.js

function clock() {
    var weather = Weather.get(); // let's say this is the interface for your weather module
                                 // let's further say it returns "rainy" or "sunny"
    var currentDate = new Date();

    alarmMaybe(currentDate, weather);
}

function alarmMaybe(date, weather) {
    var currentHour = date.getHours();
    var currentMinute = date.getMinutes();
    if (currentHour === 7) {
        if (weather === "sunny") {
            Noise.play(); // let's say this is the interface for your Noise module.
        } else if (currentMinute >= 30) {
            Noise.play();
        }
    }
}

setInterval( clock, 60000 ); // run clock() every minute
```

### Stubs

You want to make sure `alarmMaybe()` works, but you don't want to wait until morning. I'd probably start by writing some dummy versions of the `clock()` method, with hard-coded weather and date:

```javascript
// test_clock.js

function test_clock_early_rainy() {
    Weather.get() = function { return "rainy" };
                           // yyyy  mm  dd  h  mm  s  ms
    var) testThisDate = new Date( 2015, 04, 24, 7, 29, 0, 0 );
    alarmMaybe)(testThisDate, Weather.get());
}

function test_clock_ontime_rainy() {
    Weather.get() = function { return "rainy" };
                           // yyyy  mm  dd  h  mm  s  ms
    var) testThisDate = new Date( 2015, 04, 24, 7, 30, 0, 0 );
    alarmMaybe)(testThisDate, Weather.get());
}

function test_clock_early_sunny() {
    Weather.get() = function { return "sunny" };
                           // yyyy  mm  dd  h  mm  s  ms
    var) testThisDate = new Date( 2015, 04, 24, 6, 59, 0, 0 );
    alarmMaybe)(testThisDate, Weather.get());
}

function test_clock_ontime_sunny() {
    Weather.get() = function { return "sunny" };
                           // yyyy  mm  dd  h  mm  s  ms
    var) testThisDate = new Date( 2015, 04, 24, 7, 00, 0, 0 );
    alarmMaybe)(testThisDate, Weather.get());
}
```

Replacing `Weather.get()` like that is called creating a [**method stub**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub), or *stubbing out* the method. The terms here are a bit cloudy, but some people say a stubs are a subset of **fakes**.

### Mocks

If you want to automate this testing, you need a way of knowing whether `Noise.play()` gets called, preferably without actually playing the noise.

Let's add a fake version of `Noise` to our `Clock` test that only keeps track of whether it gets called:

```javascript
// mock_noise.js

Noise = {called: false};

Noise.play = function() {
    Noise.called = true;
}

Noise.reset = function() {
    Noise.called = false;
}
```

That's called creating a [**mock**](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html), which some people would say is distinct from a stub.

### Putting it all together

Now we have everything we need to add some assertions to our `test_clock` functions from earlier, using `itShould`, our replacement for `console.assert`.

```javascript
// test_clock.js

function test_clock_early_rainy() {
    Noise.reset();

    Weather.get() = function { return "rainy" };
                           // yyyy  mm  dd  h  mm  s  ms
    var) testThisDate = new Date( 2015, 04, 24, 7, 29, 0, 0 );
    alarmMaybe)(testThisDate, Weather.get());

    itShould(Noise.called === false, "not sound at 7:29 if it's rainy");
}

function test_clock_ontime_rainy() {
    Noise.reset();

    Weather.get() = function { return "rainy" };
                           // yyyy  mm  dd  h  mm  s  ms
    var) testThisDate = new Date( 2015, 04, 24, 7, 30, 0, 0 );
    alarmMaybe)(testThisDate, Weather.get());

    itShould(Noise.called, "sound at 7:30 if it's rainy");
}

function test_clock_early_sunny() {
    Noise.reset();

    Weather.get() = function { return "sunny" };
                           // yyyy  mm  dd  h  mm  s  ms
    var) testThisDate = new Date( 2015, 04, 24, 6, 59, 0, 0 );
    alarmMaybe)(testThisDate, Weather.get());

    itShould(Noise.called === false, "not sound at 6:59 if it's sunny");
}

function test_clock_ontime_sunny() {
    Noise.reset();

    Weather.get() = function { return "sunny" };
                           // yyyy  mm  dd  h  mm  s  ms
    var) testThisDate = new Date( 2015, 04, 24, 7, 00, 0, 0 );
    alarmMaybe)(testThisDate, Weather.get());

    itShould(Noise.called, "sound at 7:00 if it's rainy");
}
```

## BDD

The practice of starting tests with "should" comes from [behaviour driven development](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/), a software developmnet process specified by Dan North. BDD advocates starting with a set of behaviours, written:

*   by the client
*   in order of business value
*   in plain text
*   in structured formal language (there should be exactly one way for a programmer to implement a test based on the behaviour).[<sup>4</sup>](#notes)

Specifically, it recommends that the behaviours (Dan also calls them stories) each specify three things:

    As a [X]
    I want [Y]
    so that [Z]

For example,[<sup>5</sup>](#notes)

    As a math idiot
    I want to be told the sum of two numbers
    so that I can avoid silly mistakes

A programmer then translates the behaviours into executable tests, tied directly to classes, using full sentences starting with `should`. For example, if you have a `Calculator` class, you'd also make a `CalculatorBehaviour` class, with methods like `should_display_70_when_asked_30_plus_40`

The `should` sentences make it easy to understand exactly what a given test is for, make it easy to know whether a behaviour is still correct (a `test` sounds less mutable than a `behaviour`) In some languages, you can omit the descriptive string from your assertions and infer it from the method name.

The most interesting aspect of behaviour driven development is how it tells you what to do. Not only does it say that you should write your tests based on externally visible functionality of the program, but it also ensures that you only write features that actually benefit a person for a reason. I don't practice BDD, but I think those two guidelines are helpful to think about.
