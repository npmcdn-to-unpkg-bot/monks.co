---
[baton.js](https://github.com/amonks/baton) is a javascript library for working with hardware MIDI devices in the browser, using the new-ish WebMidiAPI.

The possibilities are endless!

Use a hardware MIDI controller or software MIDI sources like Ableton Live or Max/MSP!

Send MIDI notes from the browser to an external synth!

Make a [MIDI chat room](http://baton.monks.co/examples/rtc.html) with WebRTC and send notes to your friends without server-side code!
