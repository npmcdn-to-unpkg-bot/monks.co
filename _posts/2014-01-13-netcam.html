  <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/84020611">NetCam</a> is a RaspberryPi-based streaming security camera. A classic case of scratching my own itch, I made it because the intercom/buzzer system at my apartment was really inconsistent.</p>
  <p>Mounted inside my front door, the camera automatically connects to my wifi network and serves up a live feed of whatever&#8127;s going on outside. If someone buzzes into the building, the other tenants or I can simply visit the camera&#8127;s website for a live video stream.</p>
