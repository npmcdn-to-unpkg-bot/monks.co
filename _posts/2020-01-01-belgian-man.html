  <p><a href="http://belgianman.com/">Belgian Man Records</a> is a record label I started in 2007.</p>
  <p>In the beginning, I made a commitment to personally handle as many aspects as possible, and as a result I&#8127;m proud that my own hand has touched almost every release, be it through audio mastering, cover design, or full-on recording and production, and that I&#8127;ve personally done all the label&#8127;s promotion, web development, and management.</p>

<div class="four columns ">
  <p>Running the operation, I&#8127;ve had the opportunity to design album covers, t-shirts, and posters, plan large events, record and produce albums, and work with dozens of creative people whom I&#8127;d never have met were it not for Belgian Man.</p>
  <p>You can find my own releases and a collection of my cover designs on <a href="http://belgianman.com/monks">my page at Belgian Man</a>.
