The <a href="https://gist.github.com/amonks/8553781">xxxboxxx</a> is a midi controller, a wireless MIDI bridge, an audio-to-midi converter, and a crappy DSP effects rack, built in <abbr title="PureData, the open source Max/MSP">Pd</abbr> on a RaspberryPi.

It outputs <abbr title="Open Sound Contorol">OSC</abbr>-formatted control/note messages over either ethernet or wifi. You can also plug in up to eight additional USB midi devices and they&#8127;ll start sending data over wifi too. You can also plug in an audio source (I&#8127;m a Theremin fan, personally) and it&#8127;ll convert the audio to midi notes and send them out too.
