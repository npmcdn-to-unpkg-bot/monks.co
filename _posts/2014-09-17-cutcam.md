[CutCam](http://processing.monks.co/cutcam) is a tool for computer-assisted gestural drawing.

It uses a LeapMotion controller in conjunction with your laptop's webcam.

By physically moving your hands through the air, you draw what the camera sees at that moment. If you draw while holding still for a while, then move your face and continue you're able to capture yourself from many perspectives.

You could also get ambitious and point the camera at stuff other than your face to create multiple exposures of anything you can dream of.

If you don't have a LeapMotion controller, try [MouseCam](http://processing.monks.co/mousecam)
