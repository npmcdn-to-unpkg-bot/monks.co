<a href="http://www.where.kim">Where At?</a> is a simple tool for annotating, sharing, and collaborating on maps.

My apartment is a bit hard to find: I&#8127;m in the rear of my building, and you have to enter from an alley rather than from the main street. Normal Google Maps directions to my address end up at the wrong place, but there&#8127;s no way within Google Maps to draw your own route and send it to someone. With Where At?, you can.
