There’s an enormous market for data about you—your location, your purchasing habits, your interests. Many of the websites and services you use, the stores you visit, and the devices you carry are constantly scrambling to collect this data and sell it to the highest bidder.

But nobody has more access to valuable data about you than you do.

With Sellf, you can create a data product far more valuable than what anyone else could collect. Companies like Facebook and Google put millions of dollars into correlating datasets together, but you can sell all of your data as a single package. Google and Facebook can’t compete.
