  <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/71188740">Love</a> is an augmented reality hands-free game. Some bunnies are projected into a highly detailed miniature 3d landscape mounted on the wall. The goal is to pick up the bunnies and carry them to the liquor store. Below the landscape hangs a painting of a bunny loving a 40oz bottle of Miller High Life. When the bunnies are at the liquor store, the heart in the painting lights up with joy.</p>
  <p>Molly Conn made the sculpture, Jason Abrams made the painting, and I made the interactivity. I used a LeapMotion 3d controller to sense the geometry of the player&#8127;s hands, the Unity3d game engine to control and render the world, and MadMapper to map it into the physical world.</p>
