I often use my raspberry pi headless (without a monitor) but there are some apps, like pd, that really need graphics.

If you have x11 set up on your mac, it can receive graphical instructions from the pi over your network, so you can run raspberry pi apps in windows on your mac.

## install x11

x11 used to be bundled with osx. Now, you have to get it from [macforge](xquartz.macosforge.org)

## connect to pi

use the `-X` flag to tell ssh to listen for x server instuctions.

    ssh -X raspberrypi.local -l pi

## run apps

once you're connected, any graphical apps you run in that ssh session will show up on your mac. Cool!
