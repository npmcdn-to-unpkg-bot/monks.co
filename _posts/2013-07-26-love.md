<a href="https://vimeo.com/71188740">Love</a> is an augmented reality hands-free game. Some bunnies are projected into a highly detailed miniature 3d landscape mounted on the wall. The goal is to pick up the bunnies and carry them to the liquor store. Below the landscape hangs a painting of a bunny loving a 40oz bottle of Miller High Life. When the bunnies are at the liquor store, the heart in the painting lights up with joy.

Molly Conn made the sculpture, Jason Abrams made the painting, and I made the interactivity. I used a LeapMotion 3d controller to sense the geometry of the player&#8127;s hands, the Unity3d game engine to control and render the world, and MadMapper to map it into the physical world.
