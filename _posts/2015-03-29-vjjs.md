[vjjs](https://github.com/vjjs) is a currently-in-development collaboration platform for client-side creative code. It will make it possible to use the browser for livecoding or vjing, and use GitHub as a backend so you can easily share your code or find modules to use.

[baton](#baton) and [fftjs](#fftjs) are components that make vjjs possible.
