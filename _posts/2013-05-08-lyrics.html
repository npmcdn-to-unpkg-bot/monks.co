  Ever wish your favorite artist would write a song just for you? Your dream can come true with the <a href="http://lyrics.gy">Lyrics Generator</a>!

  It generates new lyrics based on the actual lyrics of any given artist. If it hasn&#8127;t come across the artist before, it scrapes <a href="http://lyrics.wikia.com/">LyricsWiki</a> for source material.

  I made it in May 2013 as a Lil&#8127; B song generator. Because B speaks in non-sequitur and frequently doesn&#8127;t incorporate rhymes into his lyrics, it seemed like a good opportunity for generative text.
