<a href="http://gentleman.so">The Gentleman&#8217;s Standard De l&#8217;Acad&eacute;mie</a> is a print magazine I co-founded with Andrew Zarins, Dante Pilkington, and Alex Milona. The concept was to include a variety of essays, discussing current events, politics, memoir, and fiction, all written from the hypothetical perspective of extremely conservative (by modern standards) aristocratic 19th century gentlemen.

Through this lens, we were able to exercise our creative writing skills and satirize modern political conservatives in a light-hearted humorous way.

In addition to writing editorial pieces for the magazine, my primary function was to serve as art director and graphic designer. I was responsible for layout, typesetting, and the website.
