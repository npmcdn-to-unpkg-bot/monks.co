Haunt is a game for OSX designed around the [LEAP Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) controller. You play as a *cool scary ghost* and try to collect the *cool ghost stars* so you can accumulate *scary cool points*.

I made it while getting to know [Vuo](http://vuo.org), a sort of spiritual successor to Quartz Composer. The source code is on [github](https://github.com/amonks/haunt), but don't look to it as an example of good Vuo practice; there's a lot of room for optimization.

Almost all the assets are from [The Cutting Room Floor](https://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor), a repository of unused files bundled in video games. The Haunter model is from Pokemon XY.
