[Nabu](http://nabu.monks.co) is an easily-deployable server for data collection and graphing. It constructs new tables on-the-fly, with an API based on making GET requests to the particular urls.

The idea being that someone could deploy it in one click to heroku and work with any arbitrary number of sensors or types of data without having to know anything about servers or statistics or programming.
