colorcube.js is a domonant color extractor that runs in the browser. It's small and easy to understand. It uses ES6 features that don't work in Safari without a polyfill, but otherwise has no dependencies.

colorcube.js is a port of [ColorCube](https://github.com/pixelogik/ColorCube) by Ole Krause-Sparmann.
