There are eyes everywhere. We increasingly live in a panopticon.

`surveil.social` is a pervasive game about surveillance technology. It's meant to make the players more aware of the instruments of state and corporate surveillance operating all around them.

The game takes place in real life: both on the streets and over social media. Like the many eyes around us, it never ends. Once you start playing, you'll be looking over your shoulder forever.
