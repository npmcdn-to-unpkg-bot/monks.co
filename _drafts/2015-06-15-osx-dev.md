# setting up a cool dev environment on osx

## what we'll do

we'll use the following stuff:

1.  [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) as a package manager to install stuff
2.  [fish](http://fishshell.com/) as a friendlier terminal shell to replace bash

## how we'll do it

### install homebrew

read the instructions on [homebrew's website](http://brew.sh/) to install homebrew.

Pay attention to the terminal output, and do anything it says.

### install fish

run `brew doctor`, `brew update`, and `brew upgrade` if you haven't already.

run `brew install fish` to install fish.

#### start using fish

(see https://gist.github.com/amonks/9e1227c79a40cd474a6b/)

A "non-standard shell" is a shell that's not listed in /etc/shells. So, use `where <shell>` to find shell path, and add it to `/etc/shells`.

Then `chsh -s <shell-path>`
