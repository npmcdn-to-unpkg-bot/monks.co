# Some thoughts on Earl Sweatshirt's *epaR*

## Intro

*epaR* was released on of Earl Sweatshirt's 2010 debut album, *Earl*. It's the only track on the album produced by Left Brain.

## The astounding rise of Earl Sweatshirt

Thebe Kgositsile, who goes by Earl Sweatshirt, was 16 when he self-released *Earl*. Months later, he disappeared to Samoa and wasn't heard from for years. Despite this, Complex called his album the [24th best of 2010](http://www.complex.com/music/2010/12/the-25-best-albums-of-2010/earl-sweatshirt-earl). It was hugely popular, almost cultish. When he came back, he released an album on Columbia with producer credits including the RZA, The Neptunes, Samiyam, and The Alchemsit. It's one of the most impressive grassroots success stories of the internet age. How did it happen? Earl was in Samoa!

## He had a compelling story

It seems ridiculous to argue that being sent to Samoa was advantageous to Thebe's career. He couldn't tour, record, or even appear when he was most in the spotlight. But I think that was for the better. Because of his tight allegiance to OFWGKTA, Tyler, The Creator's Odd Future crew, he had a whole team of people appearing everywhere. In fact, his exile was so compelling that the crew unified around it, creating and hyping a huge 'Free Earl' campaign.

Everywhere OFWGKTA appeared, they talked about Earl. Because he wasn't present, they could build him up into an almost mythical figure. I saw OFWGKTA perform in Boston in 2011. It was by far the highest-energy show I've ever experienced, the crowd was a weird amalgamation of the most uninhibited and enthusiastic hip-hop crowds and, surprisingly, the most active hardcore crowds I've  been a part of. Throughout the whole show, the audience chanted "*FREE EARL*" in unison. If he were there, he would have been just another rapper. But OF was never just another rap group.

## He grabbed attention

Say what you will about its merits, OF's shock-rap model worked, and *Earl* took it to the extreme. The whole group differentiated itself by looking to Eminem and employing lyrical content far more offensive than the norm. Thebe went the farthest. Tracks like the highly-explicit *epaR*, a transparent censoring of *Rape*, and his disgusting video for the song *Earl* illustrate the depths of his appeal to shockdom. But it was a coordinated effort.

## He had a good manager

Tyler, The Creator is the de facto leader of Odd Future. While the organization isn't very transparent, he seems to be in charge of promotion and maintaining the unified image. He did a great job. He maintained a huge gang of young rappers through one of the fastest upswings in history.

None of them succumbed to the Chief Keef temptation of releasing a bunch of high-profit crap until their hype died down and regretting it later. None of them had real beef or drama in the media. More impressively, no member of Odd Future left the group. While he may have coordinated it, Tyler, The Creator didn't construct Earl in a vacuum.

## He's a really good rapper

On his own, Earl is a fantastic rapper. [Not just anyone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rza_production_discography) gets produced by the RZA, it's quite an esteemed endorsement. Complex, who I'll call the authority since they [expertly deduced his whereabouts](http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/complex-exclusive-we-found-earl-sweatshirt) before anyone else when he was in exile, called him the [11th best](http://www.complex.com/music/2012/06/the-25-best-rappers-25-and-under/earl-sweatshirt) rapper under 25 and the [10th best](http://www.complex.com/music/2013/09/best-rap-producers/earl-sweatshirt) rap producer right now. Pitchforked called him [skilled beyond his years, a methodical wordsmith](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18380-earl-sweatshirt-doris/). The dubiously authoritative Smoking Section [asked](http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2011/03/is-a-guy-named-earl-sweatshirt-better-than-nas) whether Earl was better than Nas.
